Rodgen, your trusted travel partner!

In this README, I will explain how to run and test my project. The first thing you do is clone this repository to your library.

```bash
mkdir project-review
cd project-review
git clone https://github.com/a6iyyu/kuasar.git
```

After you execute the above instructions, you should get the files in my project repository. Next, you enter Visual Studio Code to install the NPM so that the project that was just cloned can run. Press CTRL + ` to open a new terminal, then type in the terminal as follows:

```bash
npm i
```

If NPM has finished installing and there is a package-lock.json file in your folder, then you can run the website with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Wait for the command to finish executing, then a port description and help will appear from your terminal.

```bash
VITE v5.2.10 ready in 711 ms

  ?  Local: http://localhost:3333/
  ?  Network: use --host to expose
  ? press h + enter to show help
```

Press CTRL and then click on the link in the terminal. Congratulations, you can run and test the website from my repository!
